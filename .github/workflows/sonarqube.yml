Step-by-Step Solution:
Add the Repository URL in the Notification: You can use the ::notice:: or ::set-output:: GitHub Actions commands to output a message with the repository URL, which will show up in the GitHub Actions log.

Post a message with the URL: Add a notification step in your workflow that outputs the link after the SonarQube analysis completes. This will let you know when the process finishes and give the link to your GitHub Pages.
